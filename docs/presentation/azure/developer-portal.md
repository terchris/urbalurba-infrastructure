# Developer Portal

## Slide: Developer Portal

**What is it?**
A self-service platform where developers can discover, explore, and consume APIs published by your organization.

**How developers get access to APIs:**
- **Browse & Discover** - Search and explore available APIs
- **Self-Register** - Sign up for API access independently
- **Get API Keys** - Receive authentication credentials instantly
- **Test APIs** - Try APIs directly in the portal before integration
- **Download SDKs** - Access client libraries and code samples

## Speaker Notes

**Opening (30 seconds)**
"The Developer Portal is like a marketplace for our APIs. Instead of developers having to email us or go through lengthy approval processes, they can discover what's available and get access on their own."

**Key Points (1 minute)**
"Here's how it works:
- Developers visit the portal and browse our available APIs
- They can see documentation, examples, and even test APIs right there
- When they find what they need, they can self-register and get API keys immediately
- No more waiting for IT approval or lengthy onboarding processes
- They get everything they need: documentation, SDKs, and working examples"

**Closing (30 seconds)**
"This dramatically reduces the friction for developers who want to use our APIs, while giving us better visibility into who's using what and how."
