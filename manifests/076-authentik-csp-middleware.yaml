# File: manifests/076-authentik-csp-middleware.yaml
#
# Description:
# Content Security Policy middleware for Authentik mixed content resolution
# Adds 'upgrade-insecure-requests' CSP directive to automatically upgrade HTTP API calls to HTTPS
# when accessed via HTTPS domains (e.g., authentik.urbalurba.no)
#
# Problem Solved:
# - Mixed content error: HTTPS page trying to call HTTP APIs
# - Browser blocks: "The page at 'https://authentik.urbalurba.no/...' was loaded over HTTPS, 
#   but requested an insecure resource 'http://authentik.urbalurba.no/api/v3/...'"
#
# How It Works:
# 1. When browser loads https://authentik.urbalurba.no, this middleware adds CSP header
# 2. Browser sees 'upgrade-insecure-requests' and automatically converts:
#    http://authentik.urbalurba.no/api/... → https://authentik.urbalurba.no/api/...
# 3. HTTPS API calls succeed (authentik-server supports port 443)
# 4. Mixed content error resolved
#
# Selective Application:
# - Only affects HTTPS pages (urbalurba.no, Tailscale funnel, etc.)
# - HTTP pages (authentik.localhost) remain unaffected
# - No server-side changes needed
# - Uses standard browser functionality
#
# Usage:
# kubectl apply -f 076-authentik-csp-middleware.yaml
#
# Integration:
# Reference in IngressRoute middleware section:
#   middlewares:
#     - name: authentik-csp-upgrade
#       namespace: default
#
# Dependencies:
# - authentik-server service must support HTTPS on port 443 (✅ already configured)
# - Browser must support CSP upgrade-insecure-requests (✅ universal support)
#
# Testing:
# Before: https://authentik.urbalurba.no → Mixed content error in dev tools
# After: https://authentik.urbalurba.no → All API calls automatically use HTTPS
# Localhost: http://authentik.localhost → No change, works as before
#
# Compatibility:
# - Works with all external domains (Cloudflare, Tailscale, custom domains)
# - Preserves localhost development workflow
# - No impact on internal cluster communication
# - Standard CSP directive with universal browser support
#
# Cluster Standards Compliance:
# - Uses traefik.io/v1alpha1 API version
# - Middleware CRD (follows cluster ingress standards)
# - Implements industry-standard CSP approach for mixed content resolution
