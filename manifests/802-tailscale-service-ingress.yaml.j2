# Template for Traefik ingress rule that routes traffic to the target service
# Moved from: net2-tailscale-host-ingress.yaml (September 8, 2025)
# Creates a host-based routing rule in Traefik
#
# This template uses variables that will be replaced by the Ansible playbook:
# - {{ hostname }}: The Tailscale device hostname (e.g., "openwebui")
# - {{ tailnet }}: The Tailscale tailnet name (e.g., "dog-pence")
# - {{ service_name }}: The target Kubernetes service name
# - {{ namespace }}: The namespace where the service is located
# - {{ port }}: The port on which the service is listening
#
# Apply with: kubectl apply -f [rendered-file]
