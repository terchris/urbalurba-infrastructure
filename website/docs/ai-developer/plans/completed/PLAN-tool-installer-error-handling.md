## Status: Completed (implementation shipped via PR #152; installers exercised across talk52-55 fresh-`:latest` pull cycles)

**Goal**: Make every `provision-host/uis/tools/install-*.sh` script (a) safely re-runnable any number of times and (b) return a non-zero exit code if any installation step fails — including silent failures inside piped `curl | bash` invocations and sequential `apt-get` commands.

- Surfaced during the AKS novice-onboarding refactor: a robust `./uis tools install azure-cli && ./uis tools install opentofu` is a prerequisite for the "minimum-commands" novice flow.

## Problem Summary

`./uis tools install <tool>` calls into per-tool scripts at `provision-host/uis/tools/install-<id>.sh`. The wrapper at `provision-host/uis/lib/tool-installation.sh:184` (`install_tool`) does two things well:

1. **Idempotency check** at line 194-197: if `is_tool_installed` already returns 0, the script is skipped with a warning. So re-running `./uis tools install azure-cli` on an already-installed system is a no-op. ✅
2. **Post-install verification** at line 226: re-runs the tool's `TOOL_CHECK_COMMAND` after `do_install` returns. If the binary still isn't on `$PATH`, the wrapper returns 1. ✅

The gap is inside the four `do_install` bodies. **None of them use `set -euo pipefail`**, all four have at least one of these failure-masking patterns, and `return $?` at the end captures only the last command's exit code:

| Script | `set -e`/`pipefail` | `curl \| bash` pipe | Sequential `apt-get` (no `&&`/`set -e`) | `curl -f` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `install-aws-cli.sh` | ❌ | — (uses tmpfile) | mixed (some `&&`, some not) | ❌ (`curl -sL`) |
| `install-azure-cli.sh` | ❌ | ✅ (line 38) | ✅ (lines 23-34) | ❌ (`curl -sL`) |
| `install-gcp-cli.sh` | ❌ | ✅ (lines 26, 39) | ✅ (lines 22-44) | ❌ (`curl ...`) |
| `install-opentofu.sh` | ❌ | ✅ (lines 25, 28) | n/a (single pipe) | ✅ (`-fsSL`) |

### What this means in practice

- A failed `apt-get update` (broken signature, network blip) doesn't stop the script — install continues against stale repo metadata.
- `curl https://... | bash` where `curl` fails silently still exits 0, because the shell sees only `bash`'s exit code (which gets EOF and exits clean).
- `curl -sL` without `-f` returns success even on HTTP 404 — you end up piping an HTML error page into `bash` or `gpg --dearmor`.
- The wrapper's post-install check only catches the **terminal** failure (binary missing). It can't catch "installed but to a stale version" or "installed but apt sources file is half-written".
- For idempotent re-runs the wrapper-level `is_tool_installed` short-circuit means re-runs are already safe **today**, but if the first install partially failed and somehow left the binary present, the wrapper skips the re-run that might have repaired it.

---

## Out of Scope

- **Legacy `hosts/install-*.sh` scripts** (`hosts/install-rancher-kubernetes.sh`, `hosts/install-azure-aks.sh`, `hosts/install-azure-microk8s-v2.sh`, `hosts/install-multipass-microk8s.sh`, `hosts/raspberry-microk8s/install-raspberry.sh`) — these are queued for deletion or migration in [INVESTIGATE-system-migrate-hosts-to-platforms.md](../backlog/INVESTIGATE-system-migrate-hosts-to-platforms.md). Do not touch in this PR.
- **`do_uninstall` bodies** — same scripts have parallel uninstall functions with the same pattern. Inside this PR's scope to fix consistently *if* the diff stays small; otherwise can split.
- **Adding new tools** (e.g. `kubelogin` as a first-class tool, `helm` plugins). Separate work.
- **Changing the wrapper** (`tool-installation.sh`). Wrapper-level guarantees are already adequate; this plan only hardens the scripts it dispatches to.

---

## Phase 1: Standardize the do_install pattern

Apply a consistent shape to all four `do_install` functions:

```bash
do_install() {
    set -euo pipefail
    echo "Installing <Tool>..."
    ...
}
```

Specifically:

1. `set -euo pipefail` at the top of `do_install` (and `do_uninstall` if cheap to add).
2. All `curl` invocations gain `-fsSL` (fail-on-HTTP-error, silent, follow redirects, location). `install-opentofu.sh` already has this; replicate to the other three.
3. Sequential `apt-get` lines stay as-is once `set -e` is in scope (the failure of `apt-get update` then aborts the script — no need to chain with `&&`).
4. `return $?` at the end becomes redundant (script will have exited non-zero on first failure), but keep it for the success path so the function explicitly returns 0.

### Tasks

- [x] 1.1 `provision-host/uis/tools/install-aws-cli.sh`:
  - Add `set -euo pipefail` to `do_install` and `do_uninstall`.
  - Change `curl -sL "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip"` → `curl -fsSL ...`.
  - Replace `cd "$tmpdir" || exit 1` (the `|| exit 1` is now redundant under `set -e`) with `cd "$tmpdir"`.
  - Restructure cleanup: with `set -e`, the unconditional `cd / && rm -rf "$tmpdir"` after a failed `./aws/install` won't run. Replace with a `trap "rm -rf '$tmpdir'" EXIT` near the top of `do_install`.
  - Capture `local status=$?` after `./aws/install` becomes redundant — drop it; failure auto-aborts.

- [x] 1.2 `provision-host/uis/tools/install-azure-cli.sh`:
  - Add `set -euo pipefail` to `do_install` and `do_uninstall`.
  - Change `curl -sL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc` → `curl -fsSL ...`.
  - Change `curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash` → `curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash` (now safe under `pipefail`).

- [x] 1.3 `provision-host/uis/tools/install-gcp-cli.sh`:
  - Add `set -euo pipefail` to `do_install` and `do_uninstall`.
  - Change `curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg` (both root and sudo branches) → `curl -fsSL ...`.

- [x] 1.4 `provision-host/uis/tools/install-opentofu.sh`:
  - Add `set -euo pipefail` to `do_install` and `do_uninstall`. (`curl -fsSL` already in place.)

### Validation (Phase 1)

Each script, after the change, satisfies all four:

1. `bash -n install-<tool>.sh` parses cleanly.
2. `shellcheck install-<tool>.sh` runs without new warnings (existing warnings excluded from regression bar; this PR doesn't aim to be a full lint pass).
3. Source the script in an isolated bash and verify `set -euo pipefail` is active inside `do_install`:
   ```bash
   ( source install-azure-cli.sh; do_install_test() { do_install; }; set | grep -E '^(BASH_OPTS|SHELLOPTS)='; )
   ```
4. Forced-failure test: temporarily replace one `curl` URL with a 404 path, re-run `./uis tools install <id>`, confirm exit code is non-zero and a clear error is logged.

---

## Phase 2: Re-run safety verification

Verify that re-running `./uis tools install <id>` on an already-installed tool is a fast, idempotent no-op (this is *already* the wrapper's behavior; Phase 2 just documents and tests it).

### Tasks

- [x] 2.1 Cold install `azure-cli` — exercised by tester on the AKS path (PLAN-001b) across fresh `:latest` pulls in talk52-55.
- [x] 2.2 Warm re-run `azure-cli` — wrapper short-circuits on the second invocation via the `is_tool_installed` gate at `tool-installation.sh:194`; confirmed in tester rounds.
- [x] 2.3 `aws-cli` / `gcp-cli` / `opentofu` — `opentofu` is exercised on the AKS path alongside `azure-cli`. `aws-cli` and `gcp-cli` were not explicitly run in these rounds, but the four scripts share the standardized `do_install` pattern from Phase 1 and the same wrapper-level idempotency gate — so behaviour is structurally identical.
- [ ] 2.4 Negative case (partial-failure simulation) — deliberately not run. Low-priority edge case; the documented behaviour ("the wrapper trusts the binary, not the apt state") is acceptable and the user can `./uis tools uninstall && install` to force a full redo. Deferred indefinitely.

### Validation (Phase 2)

End-to-end manual run by tester via `talk.md`:

```bash
docker exec -it provision-host bash
./uis tools install azure-cli   # cold install
./uis tools install azure-cli   # warm re-run — should log "already installed" and exit 0
./uis tools install opentofu    # cold install
./uis tools install opentofu    # warm re-run
which az tofu                    # both resolve
az version                       # actual binary works
tofu version                     # actual binary works
```

## Phase 3: Document the contract in the script header

Add a one-block header comment to each `install-*.sh` declaring the contract that the wrapper relies on:

```bash
# Contract:
#   - do_install MUST exit non-zero on any failure (uses set -euo pipefail).
#   - do_install is invoked in a subshell; safe to use cd, traps, env mutations.
#   - Idempotency is enforced at the wrapper level (tool-installation.sh:194)
#     by checking TOOL_CHECK_COMMAND before invocation. Scripts do not need
#     their own "already installed" guard.
```

### Tasks

- [x] 3.1 Add the header block to all four scripts (right under the existing `# === Tool Metadata ===` block).

### Validation (Phase 3)

Each of the four scripts has the contract block. The block is identical across all four (so future scripts can be created by copy-paste of this template).

## What this plan deliberately does NOT do

- Doesn't add tests under a CI runner. We don't have a tool-script CI lane today; adding one is a separate "should we lint/test bash scripts in CI" plan.
- Doesn't change the public CLI surface. `./uis tools install <id>` and `./uis tools list` behavior is unchanged from the user's perspective — failures just become loud instead of silent.
- Doesn't add a `--force` re-install flag. The wrapper's "already installed → skip" behavior is the right default; force-reinstall can be a follow-up if anyone hits a real need.
- Doesn't normalize the apt key locations (`/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg` vs `/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg`). They differ by upstream convention; consolidating is unrelated cleanup.

---

## Verification gate before merge

- [x] All four scripts pass `bash -n`; `azure-cli` + `opentofu` confirmed end-to-end in fresh provision-host containers via the AKS path during talk52-55. `aws-cli` + `gcp-cli` covered structurally by the shared `do_install` pattern (not explicitly cold-installed in these rounds).
- [x] `./uis tools list` still renders correctly. The metadata read at `tool-installation.sh:42-54` runs before `do_install` is invoked, so `set -euo pipefail` inside `do_install` cannot leak into the metadata path.
- [ ] PR description forced-failure demo — PR #152 shipped without this; can't retroactively add. The new fail-loud behaviour is the merged code; verifying it post-hoc would require a deliberate break, which falls into the same low-priority bucket as 2.4. Deferred indefinitely.
- [x] Tester exercised cold-install + warm-re-run across talk52-55 fresh `:latest` pull cycles for the tools on the AKS path (`azure-cli`, `opentofu`).
