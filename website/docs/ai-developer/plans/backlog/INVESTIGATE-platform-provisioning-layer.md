**Created**: 2026-04-09
**Updated**: 2026-05-11
**Status**: ACTIVE — **AKS Step 1 verified end-to-end 2026-05-11**. PLAN-002 (secrets parity) closed via PR #149; the four-PLAN AKS novice-onboarding sequence shipped via PRs #154/#155/#156, hardened in #157/#158. `platforms/azure-aks/` is now the production AKS path. Direction (per maintainer, 2026-05-07): helpers.no's Microsoft nonprofit grant funds atlas-on-AKS as the load-bearing end-state. AKS-only focus; other platforms (gke, eks, microk8s-vm/metal/rpi) deferred until a concrete consumer surfaces. Next concrete work: Step 2 (operational tooling — start/stop/scale wrappers so the cluster doesn't bill 24/7).

## Background

UIS currently has a `hosts/` directory containing bash scripts and `az` CLI commands
that set up Kubernetes clusters on various targets. These scripts predate a consistent
platform model and have grown organically — each target has different conventions,
different secret handling approaches, and different levels of automation maturity.

The idea is to introduce a `platforms/` layer that replaces `hosts/` with a consistent,
OpenTofu-based approach for cloud targets and an Ansible/cloud-init approach for VM and
bare-metal targets. Every platform gets a working Kubernetes cluster that is ready to
receive UIS services.

The first concrete output of this investigation is `platforms/azure-aks/` (Step 1),
which provisions AKS via OpenTofu with Azure Blob Storage remote state.

---

## What is the Platform Layer?

The platform layer is everything that must exist **before** `./uis deploy <service>` can run.
It is not part of UIS service management — it is the substrate that UIS runs on.

For a cloud-managed cluster (AKS, GKE, EKS), the platform layer:
- Creates cloud resources (resource group, cluster, networking)
- Writes a kubeconfig
- Applies cross-cluster compatibility shims (storage class aliases)
- Installs Traefik (ingress)

For a VM or bare-metal cluster (MicroK8s), the platform layer:
- Generates and applies cloud-init
- Creates the VM or configures the physical machine
- Bootstraps MicroK8s
- Connects via Ansible for post-boot configuration

The platform layer is intentionally separate from the UIS service layer. Once
`02-post-apply.sh` (or equivalent) finishes, the cluster is identical from UIS's
perspective regardless of what created it.

## Design Decisions

### OpenTofu for cloud targets, Ansible/cloud-init for VM/bare-metal

Cloud-managed clusters (AKS, GKE, EKS) are a natural fit for OpenTofu:
- Declarative resource definitions
- Remote state (Azure Blob, GCS, S3)
- Plan/apply/destroy lifecycle
- Managed identity and role assignments are first-class

VM and bare-metal targets are not a good fit for OpenTofu because:
- The "resource" is a physical machine or a VM that already exists
- Configuration is imperative (run these commands in this order)
- Ansible and cloud-init are already proven for this use case
- The existing `hosts/` scripts for MicroK8s are largely correct and just need migration

### Single config file per platform

Each platform has one `*-config.sh` file (git-ignored) that is sourced by all scripts.
This mirrors the existing `azure-aks-config.sh` pattern and means there is one place
to change values — no separate tfvars editing, no env file juggling.

### State backend from day one

All OpenTofu platforms use remote state (Azure Blob, GCS bucket, S3 bucket).
Local state is never used in production. State storage is created by a one-time
`00-bootstrap-state.sh` script and survives cluster destroy/recreate cycles.

### Script numbering convention

```
00-bootstrap-state.sh   ← one-time pre-requisite
01-apply.sh             ← create / update
02-post-apply.sh        ← configure (storage, ingress)
03-destroy.sh           ← tear down
```

This makes the execution order self-documenting and consistent across all cloud platforms.

### Relationship to hosts/

`hosts/` is not deleted. It is kept as a reference and fallback while `platforms/` is built
out. Migration happens platform by platform:

1. `platforms/azure-aks/` replaces `hosts/azure-aks/` and `hosts/install-azure-aks.sh`
2. `platforms/microk8s-vm/` replaces `hosts/azure-microk8s/`, `hosts/multipass-microk8s/`
3. `platforms/microk8s-rpi/` replaces `hosts/raspberry-microk8s/`
4. `hosts/` is archived or deleted after all platforms are migrated

## AKS — Step-by-Step Plan

AKS is the first platform. The current scope is deliberately minimal: get an AKS cluster up that behaves like the Rancher Desktop substrate UIS already targets, so atlas-on-AKS can run with no Azure-specific add-ons. Anything that doesn't have a Rancher-Desktop equivalent is deferred until there's a concrete need (see *Future hardening* below).

### Step 1: Minimal working cluster — ✅ Shipped (verified end-to-end 2026-05-11)

Scope:

- Resource group
- AKS cluster (matches original `az aks create` flags)
- Azure Blob remote state
- Storage class aliases
- Traefik via Helm in `02-post-apply.sh`
- **`kubernetes-secrets.yml` applied in `02-post-apply.sh`** — same flow as Rancher Desktop and `hosts/azure-aks/02-azure-aks-setup.sh`. No Key Vault, no Azure-specific secret integration. (Currently *missing* from the tofu draft; the Step 1 PLAN must add it.)

Other gap-analysis findings vs `hosts/azure-aks/` (2026-05-07):

- Quota pre-flight check (`hosts/azure-aks/check-aks-quota.sh`) is not ported. Acceptable to let `tofu apply` fail loudly on first run and address the gap only if it bites.
- PIM check is weaker (single-shot prompt vs 3-attempt loop). Cosmetic; defer unless first-run friction surfaces.
- External-IP curl reachability test is missing from `02-post-apply.sh`. The nginx in-cluster connectivity test (verification bar below) covers the load-bearing case; the curl test is optional polish.
- `--generate-ssh-keys` is intentionally absent from the tofu — `azurerm_kubernetes_cluster` generates them for Linux node pools by default.

Code lives in `platforms/azure-aks/`. The `feature/platform-aks-opentofu` branch was merged and the stale remote was deleted.

**Verification bar for "Step 1 done":** a tester runs the four scripts (`00-bootstrap-state.sh` → `01-apply.sh` → `02-post-apply.sh`) end-to-end against a real Azure subscription, then runs `./uis deploy nginx` and the deploy completes successfully — including the built-in connectivity tests in `020-setup-nginx.yml` (steps 13 and 15) which spin up a curl-test pod and fetch the test file + index page via cluster-internal DNS. That single command exercises networking, pod scheduling, storage class aliases, service DNS, and IngressRoute application, so it's a sufficient end-to-end signal without needing additional services for the verification.

#### Findings from first-run verification (closed 2026-05-11)

The first-run actually went considerably beyond the originally-planned "manual four-script walkthrough" — by the time verification happened, the four-PLAN AKS novice-onboarding sequence ([INVESTIGATE-aks-novice-onboarding.md](INVESTIGATE-aks-novice-onboarding.md)) had also shipped, so verification ran through `uis platform up azure-aks` + `uis deploy nginx` + `uis platform down azure-aks` instead. The verification bar above was met regardless: nginx's in-cluster connectivity tests passed against the AKS cluster, and the cluster was cleanly destroyed afterward.

Addressed during verification (chronological):

- **OpenTofu installer** — was the one known gap at the time of the 2026-05-07 analysis. Shipped as `install-opentofu.sh` (PR #149-ish), later bundled into `install-azure-aks.sh` (PR #154). Phase 1 of [PLAN-001-aks-step1-verification.md](../completed/PLAN-001-aks-step1-verification.md).
- **F1 — wizard wrote a 3-var env file missing AZURE_STATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT** — bootstrap failed without it. Wizard now derives the name deterministically from the subscription UUID (`sa<stripped-16>tf`). Fix in PR #156; lifecycle scripts also got defensive fallbacks so older 3-var env files keep working.
- **F2–F5 cosmetic banner issues** in `up.sh` / `03-destroy.sh` (stale "PLAN #4 not yet shipped" line, script-path tear-down hints instead of `uis platform down azure-aks`, `~$5/day` vs `~€1/day` mismatch) — all fixed in PR #156 before merge.
- **F7 deploy-nginx banner non-cluster-aware** — printed `*.localhost` hints on AKS where Traefik has a real LoadBalancer external IP. Now branches on `kube_context` and shows the actual LB IP + a `curl --resolve` hint for hostname-routed services. PR #157.
- **F8 missing `uis platform status azure-aks`** — first thing a novice asks after `up` is "is the meter running, and what will this cost overnight?". Shipped as a new wrapper that renders cluster state, external IP, age, estimated daily €, and spent-so-far. PR #157.
- **F9 down-wrapper false-success on aborted destroy** — serious safety bug: mistyping the cluster name at the destroy confirmation prompt printed `✓ destroyed` but left the cluster running. Now `03-destroy.sh` exits 1 on mismatch, and the wrapper explicitly branches on it. PR #157.
- **F10/F11/F12/F13 in status / bootstrap** — full-panel data correctness (`mapfile -t` over `IFS=$'\t' read`, explicit kubeconfig + context, `az login` preflight, bootstrap `read -r confirm || confirm=""` for no-TTY safety). PR #158.

Intentionally deferred:

- **`kubernetes-secrets.yml` apply in `02-post-apply.sh`** — split out to [PLAN-002-aks-secrets-apply-parity.md](PLAN-002-aks-secrets-apply-parity.md) (PR #149). The verification bar above (nginx) doesn't need cluster secrets, so this gap didn't block Step 1. Closed via PLAN-002.
- **Quota pre-flight check (`hosts/azure-aks/check-aks-quota.sh`)** — *not* deferred. Ported into the new wizard library (`azure-discovery.sh::check_quota`) so the cold cycle's first error is "you don't have enough vCPU quota" with the increase-link, not a partial-create failure 10 minutes into `tofu apply`. Stronger than the originally-deferred plan.
- **PIM retry loop** — *not* weakened. The legacy 3-attempt loop is preserved in `azure-discovery.sh::check_owner_or_contributor` because PIM activation is a normal recovery path, not an error edge case (preserve-legacy-retry-paths memory).
- **External-IP curl reachability test in 02-post-apply.sh** — still deferred. The nginx deploy hits Traefik end-to-end so the load-bearing path is covered; a dedicated curl-the-LB test would be polish.

The `feature/platform-aks-opentofu` branch was merged 2026-04-09 (PR #120). Step 1 closed 2026-05-11.

### Step 2: Operational tooling (cost control)

The bash path includes two operational scripts that have no `platforms/azure-aks/` equivalent:

- `hosts/azure-aks/manage-aks-cluster.sh` (682 lines) — start / stop / scale operations so the cluster only costs money while in use
- `hosts/azure-aks/toggle-internet-access.sh` — gate the external IP

These are not provisioning correctness, but they are the difference between "cluster burns the Microsoft grant 24/7" and "cluster only costs while atlas is being worked on." Out of scope for Step 1; lands as a follow-up plan once Step 1 verifies.

### Future hardening (deferred until concrete need)

The original roadmap had Steps 2–4 (ACR + Key Vault, Workload Identity, Networking). These are all deferred — the goal for now is parity with the Rancher Desktop developer substrate, not Azure-grade hardening. Each item below moves out of "deferred" only when a concrete consumer pulls on it.

| Capability | What it would add | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|
| Azure Key Vault | Centralised secret storage outside the cluster | UIS already has a working secrets workflow (`kubernetes-secrets.yml`); adding Key Vault is Azure-specific complexity with no current consumer |
| Azure Container Registry (ACR) | Private container registry with managed-identity pull | UIS images come from public registries (GHCR / Docker Hub); no current need for a private registry |
| Workload Identity | OIDC-federated identity for pods to access Azure services | The original motivation was Key Vault access; without Key Vault, no consumer remains |
| Networking hardening | Dedicated VNet, private cluster, NSG rules | The default AKS networking works for getting atlas running; private cluster + NSG matter only when a security review demands it |

> **Other platforms (gke, eks, microk8s-vm/metal/rpi) are also deferred.** The Target Platforms table and Directory Structure sketch above keep the multi-platform vision visible, but no per-platform question lists are maintained here until a concrete consumer surfaces. AKS is the focus.

## Shared Concerns Across All Platforms

### kubeconfig merge

All platforms write a `*-kubeconf` file. The `04-merge-kubeconf.yml` Ansible playbook
merges these into `kubeconf-all`. This must keep working as platforms are added.

The current `./uis` wrapper bypasses this by symlinking `kubeconf-all` to the host
kubeconfig. This should be restored to a real merge as part of the target management
work (see INVESTIGATE-remote-deployment-targets.md).

### .gitignore

All platform config files and generated tofu files must be git-ignored:

```gitignore
# Platform configs (contain secrets)
platforms/*/azure-aks-config.sh
platforms/*/gke-config.sh
platforms/*/eks-config.sh
platforms/*/config.sh

# OpenTofu generated files
platforms/*/tofu/terraform.tfvars
platforms/*/tofu/tfplan
platforms/*/tofu/.terraform/
platforms/*/tofu/.terraform.lock.hcl
```

### Traefik values

`02-post-apply.sh` references `/mnt/urbalurbadisk/manifests/003-traefik-config.yaml`.
This is shared across all cluster types. It should remain in `manifests/` and be
referenced from all platform post-apply scripts.

---

## Open Questions

1. Should `platforms/` have its own `README.md` at the top level explaining the concept?
2. Should OpenTofu modules be shared across `aks/`, `gke/`, `eks/` (e.g., a shared `modules/traefik-helm/`) or kept separate for simplicity?
3. What is the right home for the Ansible merge playbook — should each platform call it, or should there be a shared `platforms/common/` area?
4. Should `hosts/` be deleted immediately after a platform is migrated, or kept until all platforms are done?
5. How does this interact with the `./uis target` command work described in INVESTIGATE-remote-deployment-targets.md? The `platforms/` scripts are the implementation behind `./uis target create` and `./uis target bootstrap`.
