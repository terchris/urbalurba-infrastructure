# PLAN-011: Tailscale CLI Commands (expose/unexpose/verify)

> **IMPLEMENTATION RULES:** Before implementing this plan, read and follow:
> - [WORKFLOW.md](../../WORKFLOW.md) - The implementation process
> - [PLANS.md](../../PLANS.md) - Plan structure and best practices

## Status: Backlog

**Goal**: Group all Tailscale operations under `./uis tailscale` — expose/unexpose services and verify configuration — so users don't need to enter the shell or know internal script paths.

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-22

**Priority**: Low — quality-of-life improvement, current shell-based workflow works

**Parent**: Follows from PLAN-010 (Tailscale API device cleanup and verify command)

## Problem Summary

Adding or removing a service from Tailscale Funnel currently requires entering the provision-host shell and knowing internal script paths:

```bash
# Current workflow (too many steps, user needs to know internals):
./uis shell
cd /mnt/urbalurbadisk
./networking/tailscale/802-tailscale-tunnel-deploy.sh whoami
./networking/tailscale/803-tailscale-tunnel-deletehost.sh whoami
exit
```

This should be exposed as top-level `uis` commands:

```bash
# Proposed workflow:
./uis tailscale expose whoami
./uis tailscale unexpose whoami
```

The full user workflow becomes:
```bash
./uis deploy tailscale-tunnel          # 1. one-time: install operator
./uis deploy whoami                    # 2. deploy the service
./uis tailscale expose whoami          # 3. expose via Tailscale Funnel
./uis tailscale unexpose whoami        # 4. remove from Tailscale
./uis tailscale verify                 # diagnostics
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add `tailscale` command to UIS CLI

- [ ] 1.1 Add `cmd_tailscale()` function to `provision-host/uis/manage/uis-cli.sh` with subcommand routing (`expose`, `unexpose`, `verify`)
- [ ] 1.2 Add `cmd_tailscale_expose()` that calls `802-tailscale-tunnel-deploy.sh <hostname>`
- [ ] 1.3 Add `cmd_tailscale_unexpose()` that calls `803-tailscale-tunnel-deletehost.sh <hostname>`
- [ ] 1.4 Move existing `cmd_verify_tailscale()` into `cmd_tailscale_verify()` (so `./uis tailscale verify` replaces `./uis verify tailscale`)
- [ ] 1.5 Add `tailscale)` case in main command routing
- [ ] 1.6 Add to help text under a "Tailscale:" section
- [ ] 1.7 Validate that tailscale-tunnel service is deployed before expose/unexpose (check for operator pod)
- [ ] 1.8 Decide whether to keep `./uis verify tailscale` as a backwards-compatible alias or remove it

### Phase 2: Build and Test

- [ ] 2.1 Build with `./uis build`
- [ ] 2.2 Test full cycle: deploy tailscale-tunnel, deploy whoami, expose whoami, unexpose whoami
- [ ] 2.3 Test error cases: expose without operator deployed, expose nonexistent service

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `./uis tailscale expose <service>` adds the service to Tailscale Funnel
- [ ] `./uis tailscale unexpose <service>` removes the service from Tailscale Funnel (including API device cleanup)
- [ ] `./uis tailscale verify` runs pre-deployment checks (replaces `./uis verify tailscale`)
- [ ] Error message when tailscale-tunnel operator is not deployed
- [ ] Help text shows the new commands

## Files to Modify

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `provision-host/uis/manage/uis-cli.sh` | Modify | Add `tailscale` command with `expose`/`unexpose` subcommands |

## Reference Files

| File | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| `provision-host/uis/manage/uis-cli.sh` | Existing `cmd_verify()` pattern for subcommand routing |
| `networking/tailscale/802-tailscale-tunnel-deploy.sh` | Script called by `expose` |
| `networking/tailscale/803-tailscale-tunnel-deletehost.sh` | Script called by `unexpose` |
